// Package group holds all primitives and logic related file entity.
//
// Individual files on Uploadcare can be joined into groups. Those can be used
// to better organize your workflow. Technically, groups are ordered lists of
// files and can hold files together with Image Transformations in their URLs.
// The most common case with creating groups is when users upload multiple files at once.
//
// NOTE: a group itself and files within that group MUST belong to the same project.
// Groups are immutable and the only way to add/remove a file is creating a new group.
//
// Groups are identified in a way similar to individual files.
// A group ID consists of a UUID followed by a “~” tilde character and a group size:
// integer number of files in group.
// For example, here is an identifier for a group holding 12 files:
//	badfc9f7-f88f-4921-9cc0-22e2c08aa2da~12
